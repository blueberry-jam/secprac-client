secprac is a platform to create cyber security practice games for Linux systems similar to the <a href="https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/">Cyber Patriot competition</a>.

This is the client to run on practice machines.

See the web server with the API at <a href="https://github.com/blueberry-jam/secprac-web">blueberry-jam/secprac-web</a>.

secprac is *very* WIP (Work In Progress).
